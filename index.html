        <h2>Current Path</h2>
        <p>
          Iâ€™m an aspiring Software Developer/Engineer looking to break into the
          industry and work abroad in Europe. I want to develop my skills and
          advance in this field as with the long term goal of saving up enough
          money to pay for my pilot training.
        </p>
        <p>
          After the role of a lifetime as an international Cabin Crew for the
          world class airline Emirates, I wanted to try something new but I was
          unsure of the direction I wanted to take. During the covid19 pandemic
          I told myself that I wanted to and needed to learn a valueable skill
          and this is when I typed out my first bit of code.
        </p>

        <h2>Objectives</h2>
        <p>
          I want to become excellant at building websites and understanding
          Javascript so I can obtain a well paid position at a large company
          where I can develop and save up towards my comercial pilot training or
          to continue down the path of Software Development and Engineering.
        </p>

        </ul>
        <p>
          I have the goal to work as a Software Developer/Engineer at a
          sucessful company in Europe or further abroad with the long term goal
          of saving up and completing my Pilot Training. So far I really have
          really enjoyed learning to code and I am excited by where this journey
          will take me.
