        <h2>My Story</h2>
        <p>
          At the age of 21 I had finished my Film and Television Production
          Degree and I had no direction except for this deep urge to travel
          around the world and meet everyone that I could. I managed to obtain a
          role as a Cabin Crew for the world class airline Emirates. I tasted
          food, danced with cultures, drank experiences I never thought possible
          and made friends for life. After 3 and a half years of adventure I
          felt that I had to try something new. Whilst my original plans for
          2020 were completely turned upside down I stumbled across a video
          about Software Development and I was hooked. I typed my first bit of
          HTML at the age of 27 and right now I am excited to dive into the
          Front End Development TechDegree Program that Team Treehouse is
          providing!
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently I am enrolled on the Team Treehouse Tech Degree program,
          learning Front End Development. Which involves learning HTML, CSS and
          Javascript. My projects from this program will be readily viewable on
          my Github. Please have a look to see my latest work.

        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <p>
          I want to become excellant at building websites and understanding
          Javascript so I can obtain a well paid position at a large company
          where I can develop and save up towards my pilot training or to
          continue down the path of Software Development.

        <ul class="skills">
          <li>HTML</li>
          <li>CSS</li>
          <li>JavaScript</li>
          <li>React</li>
          <li>Python</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          I would like to work for a company that needs a Software Developer
          where I can apply my skills and increase my development as a
          programmer. Once I am qualified to apply for jobs in this sector I am
          looking to work in Europe preferably outside of the UK as I still have
          the travel bug and the desire to experience more cultures and the raw
          experience of living abroad.
